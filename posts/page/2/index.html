I first came across this command while testing a bug in a program locally. The bug only triggered when the hard disk was full, but there was still plenty of space left on it. I needed a way to quickly fill up the remaining space. I knew there was a command in Linux called &lsquo;dd&rsquo; that could write a file of a specified size to the hard disk. I had used this command before when creating a swap. However, this command was too slow when it came to creating large files. Then I remembered another command I had seen on StackOverflow called &lsquo;fallocate&rsquo;. According to its introduction, this command is much faster than &lsquo;dd&rsquo;. As soon as I tried it, I found it to be true.</p></div></a><a href=https://xinba.github.io/posts/architecture/ class=catalogue-item><div><time datetime="2020-02-23 21:30:11 +1100 +1100" class=catalogue-time>February 23, 2020</time><h2 class=catalogue-title>An incident with a server and some thoughts on architecture</h2><div class=catalogue-line></div><p>On the morning of February 20th, 2020, at 8:40am, I received a notification that the website was inaccessible. I quickly logged in and found that the frontend server of the main site was having issues. I urgently connected remotely to the AWS cloud server and found that the server was still running, ruling out the possibility of the EC2 server crashing. I then checked the Node server and found that PM2 was still running, but the application had crashed. I suspected that the hard drive was full. Upon checking the hard drive, it was indeed full. I immediately added space through the AWS console and restarted the server. After restarting the server and related applications, the server was back to normal at 8:49am.</p></div></a><a href=https://xinba.github.io/posts/owasp/ class=catalogue-item><div><time datetime="2019-09-21 17:21:11 +1100 +1100" class=catalogue-time>September 21, 2019</time><h2 class=catalogue-title>OWASP TOP 10(2017)</h2><div class=catalogue-line></div><p>&lt;OWASP Top 10 - 2017 The Ten Most Critical Web Application Security Risks> summarizes the ten most likely, common, and dangerous vulnerabilities in web applications. Although it has been two years since the report was released, it is still very meaningful for introducing web security. Especially for engineers who are new to web security, this report is a very good guide that can help IT companies and development teams standardize the application development process and testing process, and improve the security of web products. This article will classify and analyze these vulnerability types and provide some of my personal opinions.</p></div></a><a href=https://xinba.github.io/posts/exploit/ class=catalogue-item><div><time datetime="2019-09-19 19:39:11 +1100 +1100" class=catalogue-time>September 19, 2019</time><h2 class=catalogue-title>How to build a website full of vulnerabilities</h2><div class=catalogue-line></div><p>Recently, while studying OWASP TOP10, I came across a open-source web app called juiceshop, which contains various types of vulnerabilities.

Although there is still a considerable gap compared to V8 javascript engine, Quickjs was developed by only one person and is only 620kb in size compared to V8.</p></div></a><a href=https://xinba.github.io/posts/dos/ class=catalogue-item><div><time datetime="2019-07-07 18:33:00 +1100 +1100" class=catalogue-time>July 7, 2019</time><h2 class=catalogue-title>An Initial Exploration of DoS (Denial of Service) Attacks</h2><div class=catalogue-line></div><p>Recently, while browsing Weibo, I came across an interesting article titled &ldquo;My Experience with DDoS Extortion.&rdquo; Like reading a story, I read it in one go. As a backend programmer, I have long heard about DoS attacks and have been interested in the techniques and principles of attack and defense in this area. This article reminded me of a series of articles I had previously read on DoS, such as &ldquo;DDoS Attack Prevention Tutorial&rdquo;, &ldquo;DD4BC - A Hacker Group Specializing in DDoS Extortion for Bitcoin&rdquo;, &ldquo;Analysis and Reproduction of Linux Kernel SCTP Protocol Vulnerabilities (CVE-2019-8956)&rdquo; and &ldquo;GitHub Suffers Memcached-Based DDoS Attack with a Scale of 1.35 Tbps&rdquo; This time, I plan to explore DoS (including DDoS) systematically on my own, and this article is a record of my exploration.</p></div></a></div><div class=pagination><a href=/posts/ class="left arrow">&#8592;</a>
