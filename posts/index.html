Since the emails were sent in the middle of the night, it wasn&rsquo;t discovered until the next morning when the inbox was filled with &ldquo;delivery failure&rdquo; emails from the postmaster. At first, we thought the email account was hacked, so we quickly reset the password. However, we later ruled out this possibility because our company&rsquo;s email accounts have two-factor authentication enabled, which makes it difficult for hackers to log in even if they have the password. Upon closer inspection, we found that most of the emails had not passed SPF verification, indicating that they were being spoofed. Afterwards, we confirmed that the emails were not sent from our side by querying the message ID of the returned emails in Microsoft Exchange, thus confirming that our email was spoofed.</p></div></a><a href=https://xinba.github.io/posts/datarace/ class=catalogue-item><div><time datetime="2022-07-17 10:27:22 +1100 +1100" class=catalogue-time>July 17, 2022</time><h2 class=catalogue-title>Uber's Study on Data Race Patterns in Go</h2><div class=catalogue-line></div><p>While browsing through Uber&rsquo;s technology blog recently, I came across an interesting article titled &ldquo;Data Race Patterns in Go.&rdquo; The article categorizes common instances of data races that occur in all of Uber&rsquo;s Go projects. Data races are not unfamiliar to me, as mishandling concurrent reads and writes to the same data can lead to data races. I have heard that Go has issues with data races, but I haven&rsquo;t seen any specific examples until now. Additionally, Uber is a large company with many Go projects, including the open-source Zap project and the previously mentioned Jaeger distributed monitoring project, so they likely have a lot of experience with Go. Therefore, I am interested in Uber&rsquo;s analysis based on their own experience with Go projects.</p></div></a><a href=https://xinba.github.io/posts/server/ class=catalogue-item><div><time datetime="2022-07-13 19:45:00 +1100 +1100" class=catalogue-time>July 13, 2022</time><h2 class=catalogue-title>Investigating Open Source Servers</h2><div class=catalogue-line></div><p>Recently, due to work requirements, I have been delve into distributed tracing. After reading a series of documents, I planned to deploy a set of distributed monitoring systems to solve the strange connection reset error that has been occurring with WebSockets. After some research, I found that the current nginx server being used does not have good support for this feature, so I decided to simply switch to a different server.</p></div></a><a href=https://xinba.github.io/posts/jaeger/ class=catalogue-item><div><time datetime="2022-07-06 07:23:00 +1100 +1100" class=catalogue-time>July 6, 2022</time><h2 class=catalogue-title>From Jaeger to 'Mastering Distributed Tracing'</h2><div class=catalogue-line></div><p>Recently, I encountered a strange problem at work. When upgrading a WebSocket, Nginx often reported an error indicating a peer connection reset, but it did not provide any specific reason for the error. This problem did not usually manifest itself, and I did not notice it during my testing, nor did I receive any user reports. It seems that this error is not noticeable to users. I searched online and found many similar problems, but none exactly matched the problem I encountered. I was very curious about the root cause of this problem, and I suspected that the application server reset the connection when Nginx proxy connected to it. However, there was no evidence, and the usual logs did not reveal anything, so I had to put it aside. Fortunately, I have some free time now, and I want to solve this problem. My plan is to add relevant monitoring to further narrow down where the problem occurred. That&rsquo;s when Jaeger came into my view.</p></div></a><a href=https://xinba.github.io/posts/cloudflare/ class=catalogue-item><div><time datetime="2022-06-25 10:49:00 +1100 +1100" class=catalogue-time>June 25, 2022</time><h2 class=catalogue-title>Some Thoughts on the Cloudflare Incident Happened a Few Days Ago</h2><div class=catalogue-line></div><p>A few days ago, there was a major incident with Cloudflare&rsquo;s network. Since many important websites depend on Cloudflare&rsquo;s network, many websites were unable to access and even Discord was temporarily unavailable. Later, I saw on Twitter that it was a problem with Cloudflare. The next day, Cloudflare released a detailed incident report on their official blog, meeting my expectations for the company&rsquo;s transparency and analysis. Here, I mainly want to record my thoughts on this matter.</p></div></a><a href=https://xinba.github.io/posts/forta/ class=catalogue-item><div><time datetime="2022-06-08 19:39:11 +1100 +1100" class=catalogue-time>June 8, 2022</time><h2 class=catalogue-title>Forta contest</h2><div class=catalogue-line></div><p>Before discussing the Forta competition, let me introduce Forta first. So far, Forta has been developed for about a year, with a total of 1330 commits, and the main developers are two people. The development language is GO. This is not a particularly large project, and its functions are relatively clear. It is mainly used for monitoring. In addition, GO is inherently a highly engineering-oriented language, so reading it is not too difficult.</p></div></a><a href=https://xinba.github.io/posts/strapi-cms/ class=catalogue-item><div><time datetime="2022-05-28 11:12:22 +1100 +1100" class=catalogue-time>May 28, 2022</time><h2 class=catalogue-title>Issue with Deep Filtering in Strapi CMS</h2><div class=catalogue-line></div><p>Recently, while researching optimizations for Strapi CMS, I came across a warning in the console - &ldquo;Deep filtering queries should be used carefully (e.g Can cause performance issues). When possible build custom routes which will in most case be more optimised.&rdquo; I was confused by this warning and decided to investigate it further.</p></div></a><a href=https://xinba.github.io/posts/grapqlloader/ class=catalogue-item><div><time datetime="2022-05-13 11:18:22 +1100 +1100" class=catalogue-time>May 13, 2022</time><h2 class=catalogue-title>Exploring optimization of GraphQL plugin in Strapi CMS</h2><div class=catalogue-line></div><p>Recently, the CMS server has been showing red lights again. Although various optimizations have been made over the past year, such as adding caching and reducing database access, they only provide temporary relief. As the amount of data continues to increase, the problem reemerges. For example, after the cache expires, the server becomes overloaded for a period of time, resulting in slow response times or even crashes. To address this problem, the CMS was migrated to Kubernetes with multi-node deployment to improve availability. This certainly improves the user experience, but the problem has not been truly solved. The server still slows down every day and even restarts due to increased costs from autoscaling. I could reduce this problem by increasing the server configuration, but that would be going back to the old approach. It&rsquo;s necessary to optimize the code level.</p></div></a><a href=https://xinba.github.io/posts/sql/ class=catalogue-item><div><time datetime="2021-06-13 19:33:00 +1100 +1100" class=catalogue-time>June 13, 2021</time><h2 class=catalogue-title>Debugging and Optimization of SQL (Postgres query planner)</h2><div class=catalogue-line></div><p>Recently, I encountered a very interesting SQL problem at work. The same raw SQL query took significantly different execution times.

During this time, I have reviewed the various features and systems of AWS cloud, and I have also read many AWS whitepapers. Lately, a question has been slowly emerging in my mind &ndash; what is a good architecture, or what are the characteristics of a good architecture? I have been thinking about this question for a while and have read many excellent blog posts on the subject. My impression is that many architects focus on how to use various framework technologies to achieve high availability, reliability, and performance services. While this has been eye-opening, it has also given me the impression that all you need to do is master various framework technologies (including their applicability and trade-offs) to create a good architecture. However, after reading various AWS whitepapers, I have been prompted to rethink what makes a good architecture and have gained new insights.</p></div></a></div><div class=pagination><a href=/posts/page/2/ class="right arrow">&#8594;</a>
