Although it has been two years since the report was released, it is still very meaningful for introducing web security. Especially for engineers who are new to web security, this report is a very good guide that can help IT companies and development teams standardize the application development process and testing process, and improve the security of web products. This article will classify and analyze these vulnerability types and provide some of my personal opinions.</p></div></a><a href=https://xinbadev.github.io/posts/exploit/ class=catalogue-item><div><time datetime="2019-09-19 19:39:11 +1100 +1100" class=catalogue-time>September 19, 2019</time><h2 class=catalogue-title>How to build a website full of vulnerabilities</h2><div class=catalogue-line></div><p>Recently, while studying OWASP TOP10, I came across a open-source web app called juiceshop, which contains various types of vulnerabilities.

Let&rsquo;s start with a benchmark. As a lightweight JavaScript engine, Quickjs is excellent, even comparable to heavy engines like Hermes in terms of performance. Although there is still a considerable gap compared to V8 javascript engine, Quickjs was developed by only one person and is only 620kb in size compared to V8.</p></div></a><a href=https://xinbadev.github.io/posts/dos/ class=catalogue-item><div><time datetime="2019-07-07 18:33:00 +1100 +1100" class=catalogue-time>July 7, 2019</time><h2 class=catalogue-title>An Initial Exploration of DoS (Denial of Service) Attacks</h2><div class=catalogue-line></div><p>Recently, while browsing Weibo, I came across an interesting article titled &ldquo;My Experience with DDoS Extortion.&rdquo; Like reading a story, I read it in one go. As a backend programmer, I have long heard about DoS attacks and have been interested in the techniques and principles of attack and defense in this area. This article reminded me of a series of articles I had previously read on DoS, such as &ldquo;DDoS Attack Prevention Tutorial&rdquo;, &ldquo;DD4BC - A Hacker Group Specializing in DDoS Extortion for Bitcoin&rdquo;, &ldquo;Analysis and Reproduction of Linux Kernel SCTP Protocol Vulnerabilities (CVE-2019-8956)&rdquo; and &ldquo;GitHub Suffers Memcached-Based DDoS Attack with a Scale of 1.35 Tbps&rdquo; This time, I plan to explore DoS (including DDoS) systematically on my own, and this article is a record of my exploration.</p></div></a></div><div class=pagination><a href=/posts/ class="left arrow">&#8592;</a>
